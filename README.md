# Rui's data science portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio page. I am an experienced data scientist since 2013. I am passionate about data processing, statistical analysis and modeling, machine learning in healthcare, finance, tech space.

## Project list in this repo
- CMS DE-SynPUF Data Analysis ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/DE-SynPUF_2008-2010))
    > The analysis utilizes the CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneursâ€™ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF). This dataset was crafted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide a means for individuals to familiarize themselves with Medicare claims data, all while ensuring the privacy of beneficiaries. This analysis focus on the medical costs. 

- CMS Medicare Inpatient Hospitals Data Analysis  ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/CMS))
    > Processed the hospital level Medicare Inpatient Hospitals data to study the statistical profile of payment, coverage, and geographical distribution. (R language)
- Melanoma detection ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/melanoma_detection))
    > Melanoma is one of the mostly deadliest forms of skin cancer with over 75,000 cases in the US each year. Melanoma is also hard to detect as not all skin moles and lesions are cancerous. This project uses computer vision and deep learning approach to detect Melanoma via photos. (Environment: databricks).

- Restaurant success prediction ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/restaurant_success))
    > Predicted successes of restaurants using business attributes and customer reviews. Created a relational database using AWS RDS for data storage and retrieving. Visualized the data in Looker Studio [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/tf1nB1wyJ6A). Converted customer reviews into low-dimensional embeddings using BERT. Parsed unstructured attributes from JSON files. Built and tuned predictive models. 
- Semantic search prototype ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/semantic_search))
    > Prototyped a semantic search engine for restaurants using the semantic embedding of customer reviews. Used BERT to convert both reviews and searching keywords into numerical forms. Matched the best results in the semantic space. 
- A predictive pricing tool for used cars. ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/used_car))
    > Built machine learning models to evaluate the fair value of a used car. Implemented web scraping techniques to obtain a large dataset of used car listings from Craigslist. Cleaned and preprocessed the data in Python. Experimented with XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression to predict the fair value of used cars with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.
- Predicting loan defaults at the loan origination time ([repo](https://github.com/Rui0818/portfolio/tree/main/credit_risk))
    > Predicted loan defaults by Logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models at the loan origination time. Conducted extensive EDA and statistical analysis. Deployed the final model to a [web application](https://rui0818-seas6401-loan-app-jymeg5.streamlit.app/).
