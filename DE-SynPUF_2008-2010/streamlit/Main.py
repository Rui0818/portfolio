Medicare Claims Synthetic Public Use Files (SynPUFs) were created to allow interested parties to gain familiarity using \
Medicare claims data while protecting beneficiary privacy.  The data structure of the Medicare SynPUFs is very similar \
to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables. \
They provide data analysts and software developers the opportunity to develop programs and products utilizing the \
identical formats and variable names as those which appear in the actual CMS data files. 

This analytical tool will enables univariate and multivariable analysis on the 2008 to 2010 Inpatient Claims. It only serves \
as a demo for Rui's interview. It can be extended to more complex scenarios within the current framework.

More details about the dataset can be found on the CMS [website](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-claims-synthetic-public-use-files) \
and this [Codebook](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/de-10-codebook.pdf-0).
